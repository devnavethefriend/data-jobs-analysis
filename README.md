Analysis of a csv file containing over 14,000 data jobs for 2024. 
This is my second project on data analysis with python, I took it up to work with a large database and instincively come up with analytical objectives.
Most information results from this objective, so source code might be updated as I explore more.
I used Numpy & Pandas for mathematical and statistical work, alongside Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.
I handled missing values by setting a condition to check if there is. Unfortunately, this database has none.
The output is arranged in expressive print statements to make the information extracted easy and direct to understand.
