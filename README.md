# Data Jobs Analysis Project
## Overview
This project analyzes job postings and required skills in the data science industry, providing insights into hiring trends, top skills, and common qualifications in terms of experience. This analysis can guide aspiring data scientists on skills to develop and help hiring managers understand current job market dynamics.

## Skills & Tools
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Data Visualization**
- **Statistical Analysis**

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains job postings for data-related roles, including job titles, required skills, experience levels, and salaries.  
**Dataset Source**: Kaggle Data Science Job Listings
**Size**: Approximately over 1,000 job postings

## Project Structure and Implementation
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, standardized job titles and skill tags.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - **Industry Trends**: Analyzed the frequency of data-related roles.
  - **Skill Demand**: Identified top in-demand and high paying skills such as Research engineer, Data scientist, and Data engineer.
  - **Experience Levels**: Examined common experience requirements across roles.
- **Visualization**: Created visualizations for industry demand, top skills, and experience distribution.

## Key Findings
- **Top Skills in Demand**: Python, SQL, machine learning, and data visualization are among the most required skills.
- **Job Titles**: Data Scientist and Data Analyst are the most frequent roles.
- **Experience Requirements**: Entry-level roles typically require 1-3 years of experience, while senior roles require 5+ years.

## Results
The analysis provides a comprehensive view of the data science job market, allowing job seekers to understand skill demand and guiding hiring managers on role-specific requirements. Notable visualizations include:
- **Top 10 Skills by Demand**: A bar chart showing the most in-demand skills.
- **Job Role Distribution**: Pie chart showing the frequency of job roles.
- **Experience Levels by Role**: Stacked bar chart indicating required experience levels for each role type.
